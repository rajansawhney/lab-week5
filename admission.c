3. And anything else that was covered in the class so far.

Write a C program that determines a candidate's eligibility for admission to an advanced course based on the following criteria:

Eligibility Criteria:
1. Grades in Maths >=65 and Grades in Physics >=55 and Grades in Chemistry>=50 and
2. Total in all three subject >=190 or Total in Maths and Physics >=140.

Sample Inputs:
Input the marks obtained in Physics: 65 
Input the marks obtained in Chemistry: 51 
Input the marks obtained in Mathematics: 72 
Total marks of Maths, Physics and Chemistry: 188 
Total marks of Maths and Physics: 137 

Expected Output:
The candidate is not eligible for admission.

NOTE: 
1. Read input **only** in the following order: physics, chemistry, math.
2. Output should **exactly** say either "The candidate is eligible for admission." or "The candidate is not eligible for admission."
3. Input should be of type integer only.
4. If you used if/else statements for the prob1, use switch/case statements for prob2.
